Hello! My name is Taha and I'm 19 years old. I'm interested in the world of programming and currently, I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript at a certain level.

To improve myself, I try different projects and learn many new things within them. By doing this, I aim to increase my knowledge and experience day by day to develop myself. The world of software is constantly changing and advancing, and I will continue to learn by keeping up with this change.

If you have any feedback, you can contact me through my Instagram account. Your feedback will be very valuable to me and will help me to improve myself even more.

I'm always open to learning new things, gaining different perspectives, and developing myself. Thank you!
